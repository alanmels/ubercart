Ubercart
======================

Ubercart is a set of modules designed to allow you to run a store on your Backdrop
site. Development has been driven by two major emphases: flexibility and
usability.

The various systems driving Ubercart, including the product catalog,
shopping cart and checkout, order, shipping, and payment systems have all been
designed to be extended to meet any need.  Furthermore, the administrative
interface, particularly relating to processing and fulfilling orders, has been
designed for ease of use and efficient display of information.
